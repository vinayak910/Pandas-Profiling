# Pandas-Profiling
Pandas Profiling is a Python library for generating interactive and visual reports from pandas dataframes. It provides a fast and concise way to generate a complete profile of your data with a single line of code.
# Advantages
Ease of Use: Generating a complete profile of your data is as simple as running a single line of code, making it easier for data scientists to quickly get an overview of their data.

Interactivity: Pandas Profiling provides an interactive report that allows you to easily navigate and explore the data.

Visualizations: Pandas Profiling provides a variety of visualizations to help you better understand your data, such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation plots.

Performance: Pandas Profiling is designed to be fast, even for large datasets. It leverages the power of pandas and other libraries to quickly generate a complete profile of your data.


# Example: Titanic Dataset
In this example, we will use the Titanic dataset to demonstrate how to generate a profile of your data using Pandas Profiling.
The pandas-profiling will generate a comprehensive  html file(output.html) of the Titanic dataset that includes information on the distribution of each variable, missing values, correlations, and more.
